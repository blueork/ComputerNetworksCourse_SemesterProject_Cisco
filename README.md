# ComputerNetworksCourse_SemesterProject_Cisco

For the semester project of the Computer Networks course, implemented a Basic Network Topology using the Cisco Packet Tracer.

The objective was to create a basic network topology and use DHCP Server for Dynamic IP Address allocation, OSPF for Routing and implement NAT on a certain Network. Used VLSM and Subnetting alongside as well.
